Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
===============================

This is my implementation of Reguly (2021) `"Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
in Regression Discontinuity Designs" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11640>`_. You 
should *obviously* read and refer to that paper if you plan to use this.
